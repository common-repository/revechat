== How Does REVE Chatbot Work? ==

REVE Chatbot combines its supervised training with autonomous learning from internal sources (company websites, documents, etc.) via LLM. This approach enables the Chatbot to answer customer queries from both sources. This minimizes the number of unanswered queries, cuts operational and infrastructural costs, and improves user satisfaction. 

Moreover, the Hybrid Chatbot enables text-based conversational responses from LLM with interactive components like carousels and quick replies from our Chatbot Builder. This fusion delivers a personalized experience, blending conversational fluidity with interactive engagement for heightened customer satisfaction.

Some of the core benefits of using Large Language Model in hybrid mode are: 

1. Users have the flexibility to personalize the Chatbot by integrating diverse interactive features like carousels and buttons, and accessing LLM support as required.
2. Integrating LLM functionality empowers the Chatbot to deliver more personalized and contextually relevant responses, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the customer experience.
3. With LLM capable of addressing questions beyond the capacity of our Chatbot training model, the probability of unanswered queries will decrease, leading to improved CSAT scores and increased sales potential.
4. As some of the queries might have some sensitive components in their answers that LLM may misinterpret, those can be trained with care with our training models.
